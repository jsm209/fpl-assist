FPL (Fantasy Premier League) Suggestions is a tool fantasy football managers can use to ask questions of the publicly available FPL data about the different teams and players and their performance. It provides tools to query teams and players based on qualities like average points earned, ratios of being trading in versus traded out, and can be filtered to exclude certain qualities (like players belonging to particular teams) to help you find the best players for your weekly transfers.
