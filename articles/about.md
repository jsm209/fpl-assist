**What is FPL Suggestions?**

FPL (Fantasy Premier League) Suggestions is a tool fantasy football managers can use to ask questions of the publicly available FPL data about the different teams and players and their performance. It provides tools to query teams and players based on qualities like average points earned, ratios of being trading in versus traded out, and can be filtered to exclude certain qualities (like players belonging to particular teams) to help you find the best players for your weekly transfers. The tools can also inform the performance of teams in specific matchups, as well as find "risky" players like those injured or who currently have 4 yellow cards.

&nbsp;

**What are some examples of questions I can ask the data?**

Some questions that can be found out through these tools are:
- What player is the most traded in this week?
- Which players have a form above 6.0 and costs less than 8.0?
- How will team A do against team B if team A is playing at home?
- Which players on the Spurs have more than 40 total points?

**Where does this data come from?**

The data comes from the public endpoints available from the FPL API.
